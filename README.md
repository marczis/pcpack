Python Container Packer

## Project status
Idea

## What is this?
The idea is that we create a little CLI tool for packing your python projects into containers - as the next step from virtual envs and other solutions.

## CLI

### init
Initialize a python project in the given directo.

### build
Build your code into the container

### run
Run your code from the container

### publish
Publish your container build into the configure backend, likely docker hub.

### config
Change the configuration of your project.

## Future ideas
 - AWS Lambda build & publish
